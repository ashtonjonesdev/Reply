Easily send your own custom, pre-defined messages through any platform
* Create and store your own message templates
* Easily send your message through any platform
* Add, edit, and delete your messages
* Preview and edit your message before you send it
* Set a timer to remind you to respond with one of your messages at a later time

## Motivation
I was tired of repeatedly typing the same message over and over, and having to copy and paste the same message to each platform I wanted to post it to. So I created Reply, which makes it easy to send commonly sent messages through any platform.

## Features
- Solves the problem of repeatedly typing commonly sent messages and not being able to send them through multiple platforms
- Uses Android Architecture components, including LivaData, ViewModel, Navigation, and ViewBinding to make the app robust, stable, and maintainable
- Follows Google's recommended Single Activity architecture and MVVM design pattern
- Uses Material Design components for a beautiful, consistent design
